"""
evaluator/metrics.py — RAGAS metric definitions, thresholds, and interpretations.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
Instead of scattering metric config across the codebase, we centralize:
1. Which RAGAS metrics to run (some are expensive — context_recall calls LLM twice)
2. Thresholds for pass/fail classification (used in dashboards + alerting)
3. Human-readable explanations (for API responses and reports)

RAGAS METRIC PRIMER (what interviewers actually want you to understand):

FAITHFULNESS (0-1):
  "Does the answer contain ONLY information present in the retrieved context?"
  Calculated by: LLM decomposes answer into atomic claims, then judges each
  claim as supported/unsupported by context. Score = supported_claims / total_claims.
  Common failure: LLM uses parametric knowledge instead of retrieved context.
  Fix: stronger system prompt, better context coverage.

ANSWER RELEVANCY (0-1):
  "Does the answer actually address the question asked?"
  Calculated by: LLM generates N reverse questions from the answer, then
  measures cosine similarity between original question and reverse questions.
  Common failure: answer is factually correct but off-topic.
  Fix: better retrieval (getting relevant chunks), prompt improvements.

CONTEXT PRECISION (0-1):
  "Are the USEFUL chunks ranked HIGHER in the retrieved list?"
  Calculated by: for each retrieved chunk, LLM judges if it was needed for
  the answer. Then measures ranking quality (useful chunks should be rank 1,2,3...).
  Common failure: retriever returns many irrelevant chunks mixed with good ones.
  Fix: better embedding model, re-ranking, MMR.

CONTEXT RECALL (0-1):
  "Does the retrieved context COVER everything in the ground truth?"
  Calculated by: LLM decomposes ground truth into sentences, judges each as
  supported/unsupported by retrieved context. Score = supported / total.
  Common failure: retrieved chunks miss key information from the corpus.
  Fix: larger top_k, better chunking strategy, hybrid search.
