evaluator/dataset_builder.py — Build RAGAS evaluation datasets.

WHY A DEDICATED DATASET BUILDER:
RAGAS requires a specific HuggingFace Dataset format with columns:
["question", "answer", "contexts", "ground_truth"]

This module handles:
1. Converting our internal TestCaseInput format to RAGAS Dataset
2. A hardcoded sample dataset for quick smoke tests
3. Synthetic dataset generation via LLM (for corpus-driven eval sets)

ABOUT THE SAMPLE DATASET:
The 10 QA pairs cover AI/ML fundamentals. They're designed to exercise
all 4 RAGAS metrics with varying difficulty:
- Some have perfect context coverage (high recall expected)
- Some have slight context gaps (tests recall sensitivity)
- Ground truths are intentionally longer than answers (tests recall vs precision tradeoff)

    "transformers": """
    Transformers are deep learning models that use self-attention mechanisms to process 
    sequential data. Introduced in the "Attention Is All You Need" paper (Vaswani et al., 2017),
    transformers replaced recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for most NLP tasks. The key 
    innovation is the multi-head self-attention mechanism, which allows each token to attend 
    to all other tokens in the sequence simultaneously, enabling parallelization during training.
    The transformer architecture consists of an encoder and decoder, each containing stacked 
    layers of multi-head attention and feed-forward networks with layer normalization.
    BERT uses only the encoder, GPT uses only the decoder.
    """,

    "rag": """
    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances LLM responses by 
    retrieving relevant documents from an external knowledge base before generating an answer.
    RAG addresses the key limitation of LLMs: outdated or missing knowledge. The pipeline 
    has three steps: (1) encode the query into a vector, (2) retrieve semantically similar 
    documents from a vector store, (3) pass retrieved documents as context to the LLM.
    RAG improves factual accuracy and reduces hallucination because the model grounds its 
    response in retrieved evidence rather than relying solely on parametric knowledge.
    Advanced RAG variants include HyDE (hypothetical document embedding), iterative retrieval,
    and query decomposition for multi-hop reasoning.
    """,

    "ragas": """
    RAGAS (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment) is an evaluation framework specifically 
    designed to measure RAG pipeline quality. It introduces four key metrics:
    Faithfulness measures whether the generated answer is grounded in the retrieved context.
    Answer Relevancy measures whether the answer addresses the original question.
    Context Precision measures whether the retrieved chunks are ranked by relevance 
    (useful chunks should appear first).
    Context Recall measures whether the retrieved context covers all information 
    needed to generate the ground truth answer.
    RAGAS uses an LLM as a judge for most metrics, making it a reference-free evaluation
    framework for production RAG systems.
    """,

    "vector_databases": """
    Vector databases store high-dimensional embedding vectors and support efficient 
    approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search. Unlike traditional databases optimized for 
    exact lookups, vector databases use algorithms like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small 
    World) or IVF (Inverted File Index) to find the most similar vectors quickly.
    Popular vector databases include Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, Milvus, and ChromaDB.
    ChromaDB is open-source and can run in-process (no server needed), making it ideal 
    for development and small-scale production. The trade-off is scalability: ChromaDB 
    doesn't support distributed deployments like Pinecone.
    """,

    "hallucination": """
    Hallucination in LLMs refers to the generation of factually incorrect, fabricated, or 
    nonsensical content that sounds plausible. There are two types: intrinsic hallucination 
    (contradicts the input/context) and extrinsic hallucination (can't be verified from context).
    Causes include: training data biases, model uncertainty expressed as confident wrong answers,
    and the model filling gaps with plausible-sounding but incorrect information.
    Mitigation strategies: retrieval-augmented generation, chain-of-thought prompting, 
    temperature reduction, constitutional AI training, and factuality reward models.
    The RAGAS faithfulness metric directly measures hallucination in RAG systems.
    """,

    "embeddings": """
    Text embeddings are dense vector representations of text where semantic similarity 
    corresponds to geometric proximity in the vector space. Models like sentence-transformers
    (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2) produce 384-dimensional embeddings optimized for semantic 
    similarity tasks. OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large produces 3072-dimensional embeddings.
    Embedding quality directly impacts RAG performance: better embeddings → better retrieval 
    → better context → lower hallucination. Dimensionality is a tradeoff: higher dimensions 
    capture more nuance but increase storage and search latency.
    Contrastive learning (as in CLIP and SimCSE) is the dominant training approach for 
    modern embedding models.
